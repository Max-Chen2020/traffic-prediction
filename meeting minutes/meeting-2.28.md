# Meeting 1

**Date:** 2023.02.28

**Time:** 2pm - 3pm AEDT

**Location:** Melbourne Connect 2101  

## Attendees
- Student: Haoyang Chen
- Supervisor: Lele Zhang, Jianzhong Qi, Mingming Gong, Tingjin Chu

## Agenda

### Traffic Flow Theory
- We discussed how traffic flow theory can serve as a good starting point for the project.
- The relationship between speed, volume, density, or even jam factors (as Dr. Zhang mentioned in the dataset) might be able to reinforce each other and improve the prediction performance of the model.

### Data Collection
- We talked about how traditional projects mostly collect data on freeways, but for this project, city road networks or even a larger range of traffic data might be worth deeper dives.
- Moreover, since few research efforts have been devoted to roads with more complex conditions, such an investigation is more meaningful.

### Data Scraping and Processing
- We emphasized the importance of scraping, extracting, and processing sufficient quality data from digital twin platforms in order to carry out a meaningful research project.

## Next Steps
- Start researching traffic flow theory and identify relevant datasets.
- Start investigating digital twin platforms for potential data sources.

## Conclusion
- The meeting was productive, and we are excited to move forward with the project.
