# traffic flow prediction

This repository is created to store all the project-related information for the MCS-100 research project. The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `data`: This folder contains the relevant traffic data used in the project.

- `thesis`: This folder contains the thesis document and related materials.

- `meeting minutes`: This folder contains the meeting minutes from all the project meetings.

- `admin & others`: This folder contains proposals, administrative documents, and any other related materials.

For those interested in this project, I have put the proposal and introduction slides up front so you can have a rough idea of what we are doing. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to email me: haoyangc3@student.unimelb.edu.au
